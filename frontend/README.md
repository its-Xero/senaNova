Frontend wrapper

This folder holds frontend configs for the Next.js app.

Notes:
- The actual source files remain in `../src/` to avoid breaking imports immediately.
- To run the frontend from this folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want, I can move `src/` and `public/` into this folder and update imports.
